<!-- # Student Bio Page

## Instructions

* On your own, create a simple bio page for yourself using the following HTML elements...

  * A header that will store your name inside of it
  * An image that will act as a stand-in for your picture with an `alt` attribute which gives a very basic description of the image
  * Two paragraphs that will have text describing who you are
  * An unordered list of links that connect to your social media pages
  * A table that will contain three columns and some data on your favorite movies, songs, books, or activities

## Hints

* Dummy images can be found at [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com/) and dummy text can be found at [lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com/). Focus on getting the entire page working before diving into more specific text and images.

## Bonuses

* Look into how one might go about linking one custom-made HTML page to another. Once you have found out how, try creating a link from your bio page you have just created to one of the pages you created last class.

  <p> "Daniel Byrne is a graduate student in the Division of the Social Sciences at the University of Chicago with a focus in Comparative Human Development. Daniel received his Bachelor of Science Summa Cum Laude PBK in Cognitive Psychology and Communication Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2016. He currently serves as the Co-Investigator of the FARSA-2 project for the University of Chicago Learning Lab along side Dr. Lindsey Richland. His prior research & professional experience include working as a research assistant for the University of Chicago Medicine's Thirty Million Words Initiative, the University of Illinois Human Attention Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Defense project on military couples & families post-deployment, & a law clerkship with the Felony Trial Division of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. 

      Daniel's aptitude for research also translates into a natural enthusiasm for instruction & teaching. He possesses experience as a teaching assistant for traditional lecture style courses, educational facilitations, & as the independent instructor of record for an introductory freshmen seminar course in the liberal arts & sciences. These twin passions for research & teaching dovetailed into several honors & awards including but not limited to: the prestigious James D. and Dorothy C. Di Iorio Scholarship, the Charles Eriksen Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Research in Visual Cognition & Human Performance, & the 2016 University of Illinois College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Teaching Excellence Award--in recognition of Daniel's instructor and course evaluations for earning a perfect 5.0/5.0 in Overall Teaching Effectiveness on every single student evaluation.
      
      This diverse background formed the backdrop & provided the basis for his current research interests in the social cognitive processes implicated in socialization ideologies, analogical reasoning, interpersonal communication as a narration, cognition, & cultural paradigm, mediated identity, involved interviewing, intersubjectivity, content analysis, & most broadly language, learning, & the emergence of meaning."
